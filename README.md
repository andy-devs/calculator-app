## My process

### Built with

- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Mantine](https://mantine.dev/) - UI Library

### What I learned

I've started this projects to try TypeScript for the first time. I've learned how to use it with React a little bit better.

### Continued development

I think I'll continue practicing React and I'll try to implement bigger projects with it.
